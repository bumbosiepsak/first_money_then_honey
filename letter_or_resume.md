Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for a Software Architect position in your company.

Being given an opportunity to join the team, I could contribute with 15+ years of hands-on experience, gathered in workplaces of all sizes, profiles and cultures.

I aim at delivering efficiently according to long and short-term goals, while constantly managing technical investment/debt/risk.

What might be valuable to you is my dedication to given tasks and eagerness to master everything they require. I favour modern, automated, tool-aided solutions and agile methodologies.

My helpfulness and sociability could add to the strength of the team.

Additionally, please let me present some of my professional achievements:
- In 2010 I was awarded a Master of Science degree by Wrocław University of Technology in Applied Computer Engineering. My thesis involved hardware/software design and prototyping of a distributed, mesh-connetcted RFID system.

- Since 2018 I have been contributing to a portfolio of Qiagen DNA sequencing products, currently being a software architect of a medical-grade project with circa 50 engineers. This demands manufacturing proficiency on top of hard/soft skills.

- In 2017 I started work for Credit Suisse as a senior software engineer in the field of low latency trading.

- In 2016 at the code::dive conference, I presented on applied C++ template metaprogramming. I also worked on a new DECT phone system in C++14 for Gigaset Wrocław. That job included conducting internal trainings on C++ techniques.

- Between 2013 and 2015 I worked for Credit Suisse in Wrocław, developing large-scale financial software. Given the complexity, size and domain specifics of this system, C++/Python literacy, engineering maturity, vast skillset and a proper dose of intuition proved essential.

- In 2014 I sub-contracted Tieto in Wrocław, developing the Android kernel for a major hardware manufacturer.

- In 2013 I worked as a front-end developer for Nektoon in Zürich in the field of information harvesting. The final product (squirro.com) performs a semantic search of the Web, learning from user behaviour to refine results.

- In 2012 I worked for Dacuda in Zürich, an award-winning ETHZ spin-off. I was actively involved in the development of the revolutionary Scanner Mouse and a performance monitoring web application, used internally.

- In 2012, sub-contracting Opera Software, I added several features to their exciting desktop web browser.

- In 2010 and 2011, which was a period of “arms race” in LTE, my team at Nokia Siemens Networks won deals with Japanese DoCoMo provider, while American AT&T marked our base stations as a most reliable and advanced LTE solution. World’s best performance of Swedish TeliaSonera LTE network has been widely acclaimed since the very first days of its deployment. I worked on generic software components on application and system level (C++), as well as continuous-integration tools (Python).

- In 2008 at GHC Global Health Care and Charité hospital in Berlin, I redesigned and implemented the videoconferencing sub-system for the company’s flagship tele-medical product – a custom-built rescue device. Main goals were to achieve performance, flexibility and fail-safe operation under extreme network conditions.

- In 2004 I worked with micro-power RFID technology for Aktiv Elektronik. My tasks included mixed-signal hardware design, embedded systems programming and prototyping.

- In 2005 and 2006 I had a chance to work for LJ Create, a British educational systems manufacturer. This job gave me valuable experience in working in an international team, and notable improvement in my spoken English.

Please do see my references; I am also eager to present myself in person.

Faithfully yours,  
Szymon Gutaj
